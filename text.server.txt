The mineturtle server has underwent a lot of changes and upgrades to both the software and hard ware respectivly.
Is now less of a FTP (File Trasport Protocol) server and more of a Media server,
Software Updates
Emby(upgraded to Plex) - free, but unpolished media sharing software.
Plex - a media sharing application that make it seamless to view hosted movies on the hard drives in the server
Transmission - is a bittorrent application that runs in the background downloading movies from the internet, while I sleep.
Sickrage - this piece of software brings the whole project of media sharing to a new level, its job is to torrent movie/tv show files as they air. This in effect turns the server into a internet DVR. NOTE: sickrage sends all the bittorrent magnet links to Transmission to be downloaded at night (1:00 am - 6:00am).

Hardware Upgrades
Storage
I upgraded the storage capacity of the server by adding 5 new hard drives. 
+3TB Western Digital
+1TB Seagate Specialized for Video playback
+2TB Hatachi
+2 X 500GB drives
